## Random number generator

 ## Function that lets computer generate a random number within a range

 ## Formula
 ```python

 # Import the random library

 import random


 # Pick a number randomly within a range

 variable = random.randint (startNum, endNum)
 ```

 startNum and endNum are inclusive meaning those numbers are part of the options for the computer to choose Formula
 

 ##

 ## In order to set a range, check how many options there are.
 A coin flipper generator would have 2 options because 2 sides.


 Ex
Import Random


 coin = random.randint(0,1)

 if(coin == 1):
  print("Heads")
else:
 print("Tails")
